### Required Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development dependencies
npm install --save-dev @types/node vitest @vitest/ui jsdom
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cardall.git
cd cardall

# Switch to the bug fix branch
git checkout 001-docs-bug-fix

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit environment variables
# Required: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### 3. Build and Run
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview build
npm run preview
```

## Testing the Bug Fixes

### Test Scenario 1: Sync Operation Error Handling

**Objective**: Verify that sync operations handle errors gracefully without infinite loops.

**Steps**:
1. Start the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open browser developer tools and navigate to Console tab

3. Create a new card:
   - Click "Add Card" button
   - Enter card title and content
   - Save the card

4. Simulate network interruption:
   - Disconnect from network or use browser's offline mode
   - Attempt to sync the card

5. Verify expected behavior:
   - ✅ No DexieError2循环错误 in console
   - ✅ Sync operation shows "pending" status
   - ✅ Error message displayed to user
   - ✅ Automatic retry when network restored

### Test Scenario 2: Queue State Consistency

**Objective**: Verify that sync queue maintains consistent state during operations.

**Steps**:
1. Create multiple cards rapidly:
   - Add 5-10 cards in quick succession
   - Monitor sync queue status

2. Verify queue behavior:
   - ✅ Queue state transitions correctly: idle → processing → completed
   - ✅ No duplicate operations in queue
   - ✅ Queue status accurately reflects current state
   - ✅ Operations processed in correct order

3. Test error recovery:
   - Simulate database error during sync
   - Verify queue enters "recovering" state
   - Confirm automatic recovery process

### Test Scenario 3: Conflict Resolution

**Objective**: Verify that conflict resolution rules execute without failures.

**Steps**:
1. Setup conflict scenario:
   - Open application in two browser windows
   - Edit the same card in both windows
   - Attempt to sync both versions

2. Verify conflict detection:
   - ✅ Conflict detected and logged
   - ✅ User prompted with resolution options
   - ✅ No error messages in console
   - ✅ Both versions preserved for review

3. Test conflict resolution:
   - Choose resolution option (local/remote/merge)
   - Verify resolution applied correctly
   - Confirm data integrity maintained

### Test Scenario 4: Database Health Monitoring

**Objective**: Verify database connection health checks work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Monitor database status:
   - Open application and navigate to settings
   - Check database connection status

2. Test health checks:
   - ✅ Status shows "healthy" when connected
   - ✅ Performance metrics displayed correctly
   - ✅ Error recovery mechanisms functional

3. Test repair functionality:
   - Simulate database corruption
   - Run repair process
   - Verify database restored to healthy state

## Running Automated Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific test file
npm run test:integration -- sync-service.test.ts
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time)
npx playwright install

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific E2E test
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "sync error handling"
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Logging
The application includes enhanced logging for debugging:
- Sync operation progress
- Error details and stack traces
- Performance metrics
- Database health status

### Debug Tools
1. **React DevTools**: Inspect component state and props
2. **Browser DevTools**: Network requests and console logs
3. **IndexedDB DevTools**: Browser extension for database inspection

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor key metrics:
- Sync operation duration (< 200ms target)
- Database query performance
- Memory usage during sync operations
- Error rates and recovery times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: DexieError2 errors still appearing
- **Solution**: Check IndexedDB permissions, clear browser data, restart application

**Issue**: Sync operations not completing
- **Solution**: Verify network connection, check database health, review error logs

**Issue**: Conflict resolution not working
- **Solution**: Verify conflict rules are active, check rule configuration, review conflict logs

**Issue**: Tests failing
- **Solution**: Ensure test environment setup correctly, clear test database, run setup scripts

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**: Check the full documentation at `docs/`
2. **Error Logs**: Review console output and error logs
3. **Test Results**: Analyze test failure messages
4. **Community**: Check GitHub issues for similar problems

## Next Steps

After verifying the bug fixes work correctly:

1. **Deploy to Production**: Follow deployment guide for production environment
2. **Monitor Performance**: Set up monitoring and alerting
3. **User Testing**: Conduct user acceptance testing
4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with new features

## Success Criteria

The bug fixes are successful when:
- ✅ No DexieError2循环错误 in production
- ✅ Sync operations complete successfully > 99% of the time
- ✅ Queue state consistency maintained at all times
- ✅ Conflict resolution works without errors
- ✅ Database health monitoring functional
- ✅ All automated tests pass
- ✅ Performance targets met (< 200ms sync operations)
