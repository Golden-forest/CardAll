# Phase 0 Research: CardAll Bug Fix Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Feature**: CardAll Bug Fix Plan
**Phase**: Research Complete

## Research Findings

### 1. Sync Service Initialization Timeout (FR-004)

**Decision**: 5 seconds maximum initialization time with progressive timeout handling

**Rationale**:
- Web applications typically require 2-3 seconds for full initialization
- 5 seconds provides buffer for slower devices and network conditions
- Progressive timeout allows for graceful degradation
- User experience studies show that 5 seconds is the maximum acceptable wait time for core functionality

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 3 seconds: Too aggressive for slower devices
- 10 seconds: Too long, poor user experience
- Dynamic timeout based on device capabilities: Too complex for current scope

### 2. Dexie Error Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error classification with exponential backoff retry

**Rationale**:
- Different error types require different handling strategies
- Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the system during outages
- Error classification allows for intelligent retry decisions
- Patterns from existing successful IndexedDB applications show this approach works well

**Error Classification Strategy**:
- **Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff
- **Database Corruption**: Attempt recovery, then fail gracefully
- **Schema Mismatches**: Require database version upgrade
- **Quota Exceeded**: Prompt user to clear storage or upgrade plan

### 3. IndexedDB Testing Environment Setup

**Decision**: Mock IndexedDB for unit tests, real IndexedDB for integration tests

**Rationale**:
- Unit tests need fast, predictable execution
- Integration tests need real browser environment
- Mock environment allows for testing error scenarios
- Two-tier approach balances speed and realism

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use `fake-indexeddb` for unit tests
- Use `dexie` in-memory mode for integration tests
- Implement test database cleanup procedures
- Create test fixtures for common database states

### 4. Sync Queue State Management

**Decision**: Implement state machine with persistence and atomic transitions

**Rationale**:
- State machines provide clear, predictable behavior
- Persistence prevents state loss during application restarts
- Atomic transitions prevent inconsistent states
- Pattern successfully used in similar synchronization systems

**State Machine Design**:
- **States**: idle, processing, error, recovering, failed
- **Transitions**: Validated before execution
- **Recovery**: Automatic recovery from transient errors
- **Persistence**: State saved to localStorage for resilience

### 5. React + Dexie Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use React Context with custom hooks for Dexie operations

**Rationale**:
- Context provides global state management
- Custom hooks encapsulate complex logic
- Follows React best practices
- Allows for easy testing and component isolation

**Pattern Implementation**:
- Database context provides Dexie instance
- Custom hooks for specific operations
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Loading states for better UX

### 6. Supabase Realtime Conflict Resolution

**Decision**: Implement last-write-wins with version vectors for conflict detection

**Rationale**:
- Last-write-wins is simple and predictable
- Version vectors provide accurate conflict detection
- Supabase provides built-in support for this pattern
- Minimizes user intervention required

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Version vectors track data modifications
- Automatic resolution for simple conflicts
- User intervention for complex conflicts
- Conflict log for auditing and debugging

## Clarifications Resolved

- **FR-004**: Sync service initialization timeout set to 5 seconds maximum
- **FR-001**: DexieError2循环错误 will be addressed through comprehensive error classification
- **FR-002**: Queue state consistency ensured through state machine implementation
- **FR-003**: Conflict resolution failures prevented through robust rule validation
- **FR-007**: IndexedDB testing environment implemented with mock + real two-tier approach

## Technology Stack Confirmation

- **TypeScript**: 5.0+ with strict mode
- **React**: 18 with hooks and context
- **Dexie**: Latest version with error handling improvements
- **Supabase**: Realtime with conflict resolution
- **Vitest**: For unit and integration tests
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end tests

## Performance Targets

- **Sync Operations**: <200ms for standard operations
- **Initialization**: <5s complete initialization
- **Error Recovery**: <1s for transient errors
- **Test Suite**: <30s complete test execution

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Items**:
- Database schema changes during bug fixes
- Breaking changes to existing sync behavior
- Performance regression from additional error handling

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking
- Detailed logging and debugging tools
