# Implementation Plan: CardAll Bug Fix Plan

**Branch**: `001-docs-bug-fix` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: [link](specs/001-docs-bug-fix/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-docs-bug-fix/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
CardAll Bug Fix Plan focuses on resolving critical synchronization issues including DexieError2循环错误, queue state consistency, conflict resolution failures, and initialization timeouts. The approach involves systematic fixes across the synchronization stack with emphasis on error handling, state management, and testing environment improvements.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, Dexie (IndexedDB), Supabase (Realtime), Vitest, Playwright
**Storage**: IndexedDB (local), Supabase PostgreSQL (remote)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), Jest (integration)
**Target Platform**: Web (PWA), Node.js (testing)
**Project Type**: Web application with offline capabilities
**Performance Goals**: <200ms sync operations, <5s initialization time
**Constraints**: Offline-first architecture, real-time sync capabilities
**Scale/Scope**: Single user application with multi-device sync

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance
- **Test-First Principle**: ✅ All fixes will follow TDD approach with tests written before implementation
- **Integration Testing**: ✅ Critical sync components will have comprehensive integration tests
- **Observability**: ✅ Enhanced error logging and monitoring for sync operations
- **Simplicity**: ✅ Fixes will prioritize minimal, targeted changes over complex refactoring

### Project Structure Compliance
- **Existing Architecture**: ✅ Fixes will maintain current React + TypeScript structure
- **Component-Based**: ✅ Changes will follow existing component patterns
- **Service Layer**: ✅ Sync services will maintain current abstraction levels

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: ✅ All code will maintain strict type checking
- **Code Quality**: ✅ ESLint rules will be enforced
- **Documentation**: ✅ Critical fixes will include proper documentation

**Structure Decision**: Using existing CardAll prototype structure with focus on sync and database service improvements. The bug fixes will primarily target the services/ and components/sync/ directories while maintaining the overall React + TypeScript architecture.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - FR-004 specific time limit for sync service initialization → research task
   - Dexie error handling best practices → patterns task
   - IndexedDB testing environment setup → environment task
   - Sync queue state management → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research optimal sync initialization timeout for web applications"
     Task: "Research Dexie error handling patterns and recovery mechanisms"
     Task: "Research IndexedDB testing environment best practices for Vitest"
     Task: "Research sync queue state management patterns"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for React + Dexie error handling"
     Task: "Find best practices for Supabase Realtime conflict resolution"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: Project initialization, environment setup, linting
2. **Database Tasks**: Connection health, error handling, queue management
3. **Sync Tasks**: Operation handling, state management, recovery
4. **Conflict Resolution Tasks**: Rule execution, detection logic, resolution
5. **Testing Tasks**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
6. **Polish Tasks**: Performance optimization, documentation, monitoring

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Bug fix priority: Critical fixes first, enhancements last

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

**Phase 2 Complete** - Ready for /tasks command execution

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
