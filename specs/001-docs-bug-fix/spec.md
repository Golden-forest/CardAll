# Feature Specification: CardAll Bug Fix Plan

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-bug-fix`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@docs\bug-fix-plan.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a CardAll user, I need the system to function reliably without experiencing synchronization errors, database connection issues, or conflict resolution failures, so that I can trust the application to manage my knowledge cards effectively across all my devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is using CardAll, **When** they perform any sync operation, **Then** the system should process it without throwing DexieError2Âæ™ÁéØÈîôËØØ
2. **Given** the system encounters a sync operation, **When** the queue processes the operation, **Then** the queue state should remain consistent and accurate
3. **Given** conflicting data exists between local and remote, **When** the conflict detection runs, **Then** all conflict resolution rules should execute successfully without throwing errors
4. **Given** the application starts up, **When** the sync service initializes, **Then** it should complete initialization within acceptable time limits
5. **Given** developers run unit tests, **When** the test suite executes, **Then** all tests should pass without IndexedDB environment issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during sync operations?
- How does system handle concurrent modifications to the same data?
- What occurs when the database becomes corrupted or unavailable?
- How does system behave under heavy load with multiple sync operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST eliminate DexieError2Âæ™ÁéØÈîôËØØ in the synchronization system
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain consistent queue state during all sync operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute all conflict resolution rules without failure
- **FR-004**: System MUST complete sync service initialization within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific time limit]
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide reliable database connection status detection
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement proper error recovery mechanisms for failed sync operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST support robust testing environment for IndexedDB operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle network interruptions gracefully during data synchronization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sync Queue**: Represents the queue of synchronization operations waiting to be processed
- **Conflict Resolution Rule**: Defines how to resolve data conflicts between local and remote versions
- **Database Connection**: Represents the connection state to the local IndexedDB database
- **Sync Operation**: Represents a single data synchronization task
- **Error Log**: Records system errors and their resolution status
