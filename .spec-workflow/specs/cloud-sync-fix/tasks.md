## Implementation Strategy

### Critical Path
1. **Network Manager** (Foundation for all sync operations)
2. **Conflict Resolver** (Essential for data integrity)
3. **Unified Sync Service Refactor** (Coordinates all sync operations)
4. **Supabase Configuration** (Enables cloud connectivity)

### Dependencies
- Background Sync depends on Unified Sync Service
- All services depend on Network Manager
- Testing depends on all service implementations
- UI components depend on sync service status reporting

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Supabase configuration (requires actual project setup)
- **Medium Risk**: Background sync (browser compatibility issues)
- **Low Risk**: Network Manager (well-established browser APIs)

### Rollout Strategy
1. Implement core services (Network Manager, Conflict Resolver)
2. Refactor existing sync service to use new services
3. Configure Supabase and test connectivity
4. Implement background sync and advanced features
5. Comprehensive testing and optimization
6. Documentation and deployment preparation
